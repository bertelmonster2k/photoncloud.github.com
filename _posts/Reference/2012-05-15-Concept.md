MMO Concept
-----------

Virtual worlds (IWorld) have a virtual space that exists within
coordinates. \
 Each coordinate is represented by a 3D Vector. A set of coordinates
define an area (IArea).\
 Entities located in this virtual space are called Item. \
 Clients define the area (position and extent) they are interested in
and should only “see” items within the boundaries of this InterestArea.

The calculation of which items fall into which interest areas can be
very CPU intensive, especially if the items and interest areas are
frequently moving.\
 An easy way to accelerate this calculation is to devide the virtual
space into fixed Regions and then calculate which regions overlap with
the interest area. \
 The client should receive all events of the items in these overlapping
regions. \
 The most simple algorithm uses a grid of square tiles (known as Square
Tile Algorithm).

Once an item appears within the boundaries of a specific interest area
the interest area automatically subscribes the client’s peer to the
item’s event channel. \
 The client receives all events published by (or through) the item from
this moment on.\
 Since an item that moves near the border of an interest area would
cause frequent subscribe and unsubscribe changes an additional larger
interest area radius was introduced: Subscribed items that cross this
outer radius are unsubscribed, the client stops receiving the item
events.
