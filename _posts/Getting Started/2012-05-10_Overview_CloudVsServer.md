  **Server Administration.** Zero server hassle anymore. Sit back and relax while our experts take care of running the servers.                                                     You gain full authority of running Photon for your applications. You run your own servers or rent fitting ones and make sure they are available for your users. Photon's logs and performance counters provide all necessary information about low level performance and stability.

  **Scalability.** The Photon Cloud scales automatically to accommodate all your users. Using our SDKs your client application is built for an efficient load-balancing workflow.   Our Load-balancing Power-Up is available in source code. It is a solid foundation to scale across multiple servers. Running the right number of servers for your customers is your responsibility.

  **Licensing.** Choose what fits you best: ongoing subscriptions or pre-paid options. You get cloud hosting and rent Photon in one package.\                                       Licenses are bought through the shop and provided as download. Cheaper licenses limit the number of concurrent users per server. Optionally, an Enterprise License is available for any number of servers upon request.

  **Game logic.** All custom logic takes place on the application client to allow a zero-hassle experience.                                                                         The server's logic can be fully customized in C\#. Several pre-defined applications are available as source and provide a high performance framework for your application. Benefit from our protocols and abstraction of low level functionality and add any feature you might be missing.
