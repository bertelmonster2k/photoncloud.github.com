We used the **Third Person MMO Controller** demo from the Unity
Technologies team to show you **how to add multiplayer functionality**
to an existing project using Photon Unity Networking technology. Combine
the ease-of-use of Unity Networking with the performance and reliability
of the Photon Network Engine.

Actually not a demo, this **free plugin** combines the ease-of-use of
Unity's Networking with the performance and reliability of [Exit Games'
Photon Network Engine](http://www.exitgames.com/Photon).

A script ports your Unity Networking project. 90% chores: Done.
